# clock2002
This is the public repository for the Windows 2002 Clock app, a multi-purpose Clock app.

The Clock app in Windows 2002 provides a quick and easy to use modern clock app, in a much older environment.

It features the following features:

## Alarm scheduler

You can add as many alarms as you want, letting you have as many alarms as you want. You can choose whether to repeat or not the alarm on the days, and on which days. 
You can also choose additional system options, such as waking up the computer from sleep mode, or turning on the monitor when the alarm goes out.
(The alarm scheduler feature is powered by Microsoft Access. You might ask yourself if Windows 2002 has Access installed, but it actually has only the runtime installed.)

## World clock

With the world clock, you can see al the timezones of the entire world. On the bottom, you can see all the timezones, with a live clock too next to it.

## Stopwatch

Well, it's - a stopwatch. You can make it start, stop, and then mark certain timestamps. These timestamps will be shown to you on the right side of the app, in the "saved times" list.

## Timer
![Fucker-2023-03-09-00-18-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87281326/223875642-037a38a7-5aca-4292-904a-f36c061bd352.png)

It's a timer. Once ended, a notification will pop up on the system tray icon, letting you know that the timer ended. You can also pause it while it is running, and then resume afterwards.

## Pomodoro timer
![Fucker-2023-03-09-00-18-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87281326/223875797-a31d8928-e98c-45f4-adb6-4e1dfe318a86.png)

Like all the respectable clock apps, this app includes a Pomodoro timer. It lets you choose how many sessions you want, and even how much each work and break session should be.
In the "current session" part, you'll be shown an icon representing in which session you're currently are, along with a progress bar telling how far you've come.

Once a session changes, the icon in the system tray will change accoridng to the current session you're in, and you'll be notified with a balloon also of how much time you have left in that current session, so you don't need to keep an hour on the Clock window while working (so you can also not be distracted)

Last but not least, the systray icon provides a quick menu to the primary features of the app, such as starting a stopwatch, timer, or starting a pomodoro session.
